# Movie Booking System Database Project

# Introduction
This project is designed to implement a database system for a Movie Booking System, which facilitates the management of movies, theaters, show timings, customer bookings, and payments. The system aims to allow users to view available movies, book tickets, and make payments. Administrators can also manage movie listings, theater details, and show schedules.

# Database Design
# 1. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The database schema is structured using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that defines the following entities and their relationships:

Movie: Represents the movies available in the system.
Theater: Represents the theaters where movies are shown.
Show: Represents the schedule of a particular movie being shown at a theater.
Customer: Represents customers who make bookings.
Booking: Represents the actual bookings made by customers for a movie show.
Payment: Represents payment details for a specific booking.
# Relationships:
A Movie can have multiple Shows.
A Theater can host multiple Shows.
A Customer can have multiple Bookings.
A Booking is linked to exactly one Payment.

# 2. Database Queries
Here are some sample queries that retrieve specific data from the system:

a. List all movies available in a specific genre.

SELECT Title, Genre, Rating
FROM Movies
WHERE Genre = 'Action';
b. View all shows for a particular movie on a given date.

SELECT T.Name AS Theater, S.ShowTime, S.Price
FROM Shows S
JOIN Theaters T ON S.TheaterID = T.TheaterID
WHERE S.MovieID = 1 AND S.Date = '2025-02-01';
c. Retrieve all bookings made by a particular customer.

SELECT B.BookingID, M.Title, S.ShowTime, B.SeatNumber, B.TotalPrice
FROM Bookings B
JOIN Shows S ON B.ShowID = S.ShowID
JOIN Movies M ON S.MovieID = M.MovieID
WHERE B.CustomerID = 101;
d. Retrieve the total revenue generated by a theater on a specific date.

SELECT T.Name AS Theater, SUM(S.Price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Shows S
JOIN Theaters T ON S.TheaterID = T.TheaterID
WHERE S.Date = '2025-02-01'
GROUP BY T.Name;

# 3. Database Features

Show Management: Movies can be scheduled in various theaters, with pricing and show times configurable.
Customer Bookings: Customers can view available shows and make bookings by selecting seats.
Payment Integration: Customers can make payments for their bookings using various payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal).
# 4. Technologies Used
PostgreSQL: A relational database management system (RDBMS) used to store and manage data.
SQL: The queries used for data manipulation and retrieval.
# 5. Project Usage
Admin Panel: To manage movies, theaters, and show schedules.
Customer Panel: For customers to view available shows, make bookings, and pay for tickets.
Reports: The system provides reports on total revenue per theater and booking history per customer.
